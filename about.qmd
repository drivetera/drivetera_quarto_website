## Research Experiences 🔬

### **Atmospheric Composition and Climate Lab**  
*Research Assistant* (Sep. 2023 – Present)  
- Investigated the impact of aerosol and GHG forcings on the global monsoon system.  
- Employed NCAR’s LENS2 model experiments to isolate the effects of individual forcings.  
- Findings suggest intensification of the Asian Summer Monsoon until 2060 due to greenhouse gas forcing.

### **Environmental Change and Human Outcomes Lab**  
*Research Assistant* (Jun. – Sep. 2023)  
- Analyzed rainfall and political outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa using CHIRPS and conflict datasets.  
- Identified connections between rainfall variability and political violence through causal inference methods.

### **Stanford at Sea Program**  
*Carbon System Researcher* (Apr. – Sep. 2022)  
- Conducted an inorganic carbon survey during SEA Cruise S-303.  
- Linked intermediate-depth pH decreases to La Niña events and water mass tracers.

### **Severe Weather and Climate Lab**  
*Research Assistant* (Jun. – Sep. 2020)  
- Evaluated biases in CMIP6 models of the North American Monsoon.  
- Found that global warming scenarios consistently weaken monsoon systems.
